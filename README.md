# Shipping Label Finder
## Description
This Python script reduces e-commerce retailers' hassle of shuffling around hundreds and thousands of shipping labels to match the order number with the correct label. Using an external Label Scanner to scan the product ID attached to a product, the program can precisely and promptly locate the matched label and print it out. This program has saved up to 80% of the package processing time.
